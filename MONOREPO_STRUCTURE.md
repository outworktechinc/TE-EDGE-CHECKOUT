# Monorepo Structure - Universal Packages

## ✅ Successfully Restructured!

The repository has been successfully converted into a **monorepo** structure using npm workspaces. Each package is now completely independent and can be published/installed separately.

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Complete Independence
- Each package has its **own `package.json`**
- Each package has its **own dependencies**
- Each package has its **own version number**
- Each package can be **published separately**

### ✅ Selective Installation
Users install only what they need:

```bash
# Install ONLY payment gateway
npm install @your-org/payment-gateway

# Install ONLY sentry integration (when available)
npm install @your-org/sentry-integration

# Install ONLY track-ids (when available)
npm install @your-org/track-ids
```

**No bloat!** Users who only need payments won't install sentry or tracking code.

### ✅ Workspace Management
From root, manage all packages:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Build specific package
npm run build:payment
npm run build:sentry
npm run build:track-ids

# Test all packages
npm run test

# Publish specific package
npm run publish:payment
```

## 📦 Package Status

| Package | Status | Version | Description |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `@your-org/payment-gateway` | ✅ **Production** | 1.0.0 | Payment gateway integration |
| `@your-org/sentry-integration` | 🚧 Coming Soon | 1.0.0 | Error tracking |
| `@your-org/track-ids` | 🚧 Coming Soon | 1.0.0 | Analytics tracking |

---

## 📋 Adding New Packages

### Step 1: Create Package Directory
```bash
mkdir -p packages/your-new-package
cd packages/your-new-package
```

### Step 2: Initialize Package
```bash
npm init -y
```

### Step 3: Update package.json
```json
{
  "name": "@your-org/your-new-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Your package description",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts"
}
```

### Step 4: Add Build Script
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Create Source Files
```bash
mkdir src
# Add your source files
```

### Step 6: Add to Root Scripts (Optional)
Edit root `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:your-package": "npm run build --workspace=packages/your-new-package"
  }
}
```

### Step 7: Build & Test
```bash
cd packages/your-new-package
npm run build
npm run test
```

**That's it!** Your package is now part of the monorepo.

## 🎨 Package Guidelines

When creating a new package, ensure:

### Required Files
- ✅ `package.json` with correct name and version
- ✅ `README.md` with usage examples
- ✅ `src/` directory with TypeScript source
- ✅ `tsconfig.json` for compilation
- ✅ `.gitignore` for build artifacts

### Best Practices
- ✅ Use `@your-org/package-name` naming convention
- ✅ Keep packages **framework-agnostic**
- ✅ Include **comprehensive documentation**
- ✅ Add **TypeScript types** (`.d.ts`)
- ✅ Support **CommonJS and ESM** builds
- ✅ Include **examples** directory
- ✅ Write **tests** for all features
- ✅ Create **framework-specific guides** (Next.js, Angular, etc.)

### Documentation Checklist
- ✅ README.md with overview
- ✅ Installation instructions
- ✅ Quick start guide
- ✅ API reference
- ✅ Examples
- ✅ Framework integration guides
- ✅ Troubleshooting section

## 🔄 Workflow Examples

### Scenario 1: User Wants Only Payment Gateway

```bash
# User installs
npm install @your-org/payment-gateway

# Package size: ~50KB
# Dependencies: Only payment-gateway deps
# No sentry, no tracking code included!
```

### Scenario 2: User Wants Multiple Packages

```bash
# User installs multiple packages
npm install @your-org/payment-gateway @your-org/sentry-integration

# Each package is independent
# No shared dependencies forced
```

### Scenario 3: Developer Working on Monorepo

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/universal-packages.git
cd universal-packages

# Install all packages
npm install

# Work on payment-gateway
cd packages/payment-gateway
# Make changes...
npm run build

# Test locally
npm link

# In test project
npm link @your-org/payment-gateway

# Publish when ready
npm publish
```

## 📊 Package Comparison

| Aspect | Before (Single Package) | After (Monorepo) |
|--------|------------------------|------------------|
| Structure | All code in one place | Organized by package |
| Installation | Install everything | Install only what you need |
| Versioning | Single version | Independent versions |
| Publishing | Publish all together | Publish independently |
| Dependencies | Shared dependencies | Independent dependencies |
| Size | Large bundle | Small, focused packages |

---

## ⚡ Performance Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ **Smaller bundle sizes** - Only install needed code
- ✅ **Faster installs** - Fewer dependencies
- ✅ **Cleaner node_modules** - No unnecessary packages

### For Developers
- ✅ **Better organization** - Clear package boundaries
- ✅ **Independent releases** - Update one without others
- ✅ **Parallel development** - Work on multiple packages
- ✅ **Easier testing** - Test packages in isolation

---

## 🔐 Publishing Workflow

### Publish Payment Gateway

```bash
# From root
npm run publish:payment

# Or from package
cd packages/payment-gateway
npm publish
```

### Version Bumps

```bash
cd packages/payment-gateway
npm version patch  # 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
npm version minor  # 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
npm version major  # 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0
npm publish
```

### Pre-release Versions

```bash
npm version prepatch --preid=beta  # 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1-beta.0
npm publish --tag beta
```

---

## 🎯 Git Workflow

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commits:
```bash
# For payment-gateway changes
git commit -m "feat(payment): add Stripe redirect support"

# For sentry-integration changes
git commit -m "feat(sentry): initial implementation"

# For multiple packages
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies across all packages"
```

### Branching Strategy

```bash
# Feature branches per package
git checkout -b feature/payment-gateway-stripe-redirect
git checkout -b feature/sentry-integration-init

# Or general features
git checkout -b feature/add-new-package
```
